#Programming Background
##I know C, C++, Ruby, Python, PHP, PERL, HTML, R, and can work with Drupal.
## This is some more content for the last part, I really like pizza. Pepporoni pineapple
## wins the day!
## I've done some interesting dynamic scripting things, as well as large data processing for laboratories on campus.
## These were difficult because I am a scrub.
## I hope that as time goes on, projects like these become easier.
## My favorite project in 162 was Conway's Game of Life, or the Doom Train.
